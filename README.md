# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer picks a word from a list and the user tries to guess it. 

The player will have 5 lives to completely guess the word.

Each incorrect guess will reduce the number of lives by one.

After each guess the player will be shown the correct letters they have guessed so far and how many letters are left to guess.

This will be done by use of a Hangman class.

The game is found in a single file - milestone_5.py
